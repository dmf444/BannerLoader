# BannerLoader
Congratulations! You have made it to this repository, which means you are interested in either the code or the wiki on how to use this mod. Not sure if i'll open source this mod, it may eventually become open source, but as of right now, I'm keeping it as a closed source mod.

#MODPACK LICENSE:
This mod is allowed in *most* mod pack. The only rule is if the modpack has over 200,000 downloads/players I'd request that you tell me that you're using it in the pack. Obviously, I can't force anyone to follow that rule, but it is greatly appriciated.

#How to use the Mod:
See the Wiki (tab near to of the page)
this repo contains a sample of how to use the mod.
